# fpdf
FPDF is a PHP class which allows to generate PDF files with pure PHP, that is to say without using the PDFlib library. F from FPDF stands for Free: you may use it for any kind of usage and modify it to suit your needs

This is a mirror of the fpdf libary available at http://fpdf.org. You should preferably download it from there, as this is intended as a backup copy. Docs are available there, and all inquires should be submitted via their official channels. No support is offered in this repository whatsoever.
